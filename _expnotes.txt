- chemistry
-- list of chemicals
--- what does each one do? 
--- which step?
--- which brands mention which chemicals?
--- chem in search fields
-- health and safety --- when do they mention it?
-- fume extraction
-- environmental safety
-- eye safety
-- inhalation
- concrete examples at each step
- what is the purpose at each step?
- high level summary

- give user controls to fill context window
- but also traditional search, sort, and filter to change views
- can use semantic similarity in building the vis views
- unit vis again

- let the user fill the context window with instruction sets



02_B

- It's bringing in knowledge it knows
-- paternalistic safety warnings
-- "be sure to consult current data sheets"
-- maybe we want to kill this, or maybe not
--- safety issue about chemicals now known to be harmful
---- e.g., "fume the mercury"

-- Maybe use approved summary as a schema to prompt every model
--- We don't want it overindexing on one set of instructions if what we want is general advice about how to process photos
-- manufacturers can use their own terminology, we need to standardize this
--- Rinsing (Kodak) vs stop bath



Should this app talk to Paperbase?
- How do we get it to share instructions across all relevant papers?
- "Show me a summary of how to process Kodabromide?" (from Paperbase)

Traditional OCR not great for tables
- Maybe need to use GPT-4 Vision


01_agg

- Summaries of summaries are better
-- the long context raw summaries include too many specifics and aren't as organized
-- and to be fair, the sum-of-sum approach gets to read MORE examples
- System prompt doesn't seem to help, and if anything, hurts?
- You can always use your own template! And learn it from the data!
-- For anything you will reuse, you can just rerun until you get what you like
-- You're a judge now, not a worker


TEMPLATE
- derive from sum of sums
- use for tagging or JSON, perhaps
- apply to all items via JSON extraction
-- and then we will have to try to standardize the values for each JSON key


APP ANSWER Q
-What is missing? What is left out?
-- environmental safety
-- proper disposal and handling
- Can the app recommend a generic approach to making a photograph?
